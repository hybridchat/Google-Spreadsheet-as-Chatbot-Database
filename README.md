We see a lot of sales and business teams using spreadsheets as a database. And why not? Spreadsheets are easy to use, edit and quickly collaborate on with not much learning curve.

**Requirements:**
1. Google Spreadsheet (Free)
2. [Hybrid.Chat](https://hybrid.chat/ "Hybrid.Chat") (Free tier)

Hybrid.Chat already allows you to use Google spreadsheet as a CMS (content management system) for your chatbot. Chatbots can also be connected directly to any SQL Database to perform any query. But now, you can use a simple spreadsheet as a database within your chatbot that both Sales team and Chatbot can interact with easily, to enable perfect co-bot synergy (where humans and bots work together) 

**Demo Database Chatbot:**
Meet Zippy - example chatbot created that remembers all 33,000 Zip codes in the United States and can fetch details about it using Database loaded in the Chatbot spreadsheet itself.
