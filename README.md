We see a lot of sales and business teams using spreadsheets as a database. And why not? Spreadsheets are easy to use, edit and quickly collaborate on with not much learning curve.

**Requirements:**
1. Google Spreadsheet (Free)
2. [Hybrid.Chat](https://hybrid.chat/ "Hybrid.Chat") (Free tier)

Hybrid.Chat already allows you to use Google spreadsheet as a CMS (content management system) for your chatbot. [Chatbots can also be connected directly to any SQL Database](https://hybrid.chat/documentation/#database-queries "Chatbots can also be connected directly to any SQL Database") to perform any query. But now, you can use a simple spreadsheet as a database within your chatbot that both Sales team and Chatbot can interact with easily, to enable perfect [co-bot synergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobot "co-bot synergy") (where humans and bots work together) 

**Demo Database Chatbot:**
Meet Zippy - example chatbot created that remembers all 33,000 Zip codes in the United States and can fetch details about it using Database loaded in the Chatbot spreadsheet itself.

**Use cases:**

**Ecommerce Order Management:**
You can have a webhook pushing data from all orders into a spreadsheet for all your orders and provide support to any customer coming in, asking for order update.

**Quote Calculators:**
[Chatbot can perform calculations](https://hybrid.chat/documentation/#performing-calculations "Chatbot can perform calculations") based upon user input, letting it calculate quote for a product, which is far more intuitive that form based calculators, while also collecting lead data using Facebook Chat campaigns or normal web chatbot embeds.
